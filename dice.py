"""Functions that simulate dice rolls

A die is a function that takes no arguments and returns a number from 1 to n
(inclusive), where n is the number of sides on the die.

Types of dice:

    Dice can be fair, meaning that they produce each possible outcome with equal
    probability.  

    For testing functions that use dice, this file also defines a deterministic
    die, which always cycles among a fixed set of values when it is rolled.

All functions defined in this module are higher-order functions that return dice.
